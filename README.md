# PhoneBook
An terminal-based exercise utilizing only Java's built-in Arrays to create a functional, computer-centric phone book.  Provides basic capability for saving and loading a PhoneBook, so entries are not lost after closing the program.
The files for the PhoneBook are as follows:
<ul>
  <li><em>Address.java</em>: allows for the creation/instantiation of a person's address.</li>
  <li><em>Person.java</em>: allows for the creation/instantiation of a person.</li>
  <li><em>PhoneBook.java</em>: contains all of the functions and logic for managing Person and Address objects, including searching, adding, and deleting Persons from the PhoneBook.</li>
  <li><em>PhoneBookUI.java</em>: contains all of the logic and handling regarding the user interface.</li>
  <li><em>Main.java</em>: the client for the PhoneBook.</li>
</ul>
